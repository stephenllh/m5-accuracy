## About The Project

<br/>
Given hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, we need to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days.

This is my solution to the [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy) Kaggle competition. I used a LightGBM to train on the tabular dataset, which was preprocessed to include 7-day and 28-day rolling mean features.

Result: Weighted root mean squared scaled error (RMSSE) score of 0.63730
 in the [private leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/leaderboard). Ranked 248 out of 5558 teams (Top 5% - silver medal).
